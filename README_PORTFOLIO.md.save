# Secure Active Directory Deployment – Azure + Windows Server 2025

This project demonstrates a cloud-hosted Active Directory environment built on **Windows Server 2025** within **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**. It includes a domain controller, a client VM, organizational units, security groups, and automated user creation via **PowerShell scripts**. Key security policies, including 12-character passwords and account lockouts, were enforced using **Group Policy**, and compliance was documented with an HTML GPO report. Screenshots validate each step of deployment, from Azure network setup to client domain join and policy application. This repository highlights practical skills in **Azure infrastructure, Windows Server administration, Active Directory, PowerShell automation, and security best practices**, making it an ideal portfolio piece for entry-level IT and cybersecurity roles.
